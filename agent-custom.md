# Agent Customizations

> **✏️ EDITABLE FILE**: This is where humans should record their customizations.  
> **The agent will read this file and apply your preferences.**

---

## Purpose

This file allows you to customize the agent's behavior for your specific needs, organization, or project without modifying the core `agent.md` instructions.

**The agent reads this file alongside `agent.md` to understand your preferences.**

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Add your customizations below** in the appropriate sections
2. **Be specific** - the more detail you provide, the better the agent can tailor its behavior
3. **Update regularly** - add new preferences as you discover them
4. **Don't delete sections** - leave empty sections in place for future use
