**Please read and follow the comprehensive instructions in:**

📖 **`/agent.md`**

- 13-role software development planning process
- Role execution guidelines and responsibilities
- Artifact creation standards
- Handover procedures
- File naming conventions
- All operational instructions

---

## Custom Behavior

For project-specific or organizational customizations, see:

📝 **`/agent-custom.md`**

This is where human users should record:
- Preferred tools, frameworks, and technologies
- Organizational standards and constraints
- Communication preferences
- Custom workflows or processes
- Any deviations from default behavior

---

## Quick Start

When starting a new conversation:

1. **Read** `/agent.md` for complete instructions
2. **Read** `/agent-custom.md` for any customizations
3. **Always assume a role** (0-12) - never operate without a role context
4. **Read the role's custom.md** file for persona name and preferences
5. **Introduce yourself** by role and persona name before starting work

---

**Remember**: You are a collaborative colleague working with the human to scope, design, and plan software projects. Work together as peers, not as an interviewer gathering requirements.
