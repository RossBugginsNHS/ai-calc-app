# Backlog

This folder contains unrefined ideas and items. Anyone can add rough thoughts here.

## How to Add Items

Simply create a markdown file with your idea:

```bash
echo "# My Idea\n\nQuick description..." > docs/work/backlog/my-idea.md
git add docs/work/backlog/my-idea.md
git commit -m "Add backlog item: my-idea"
```

## What Goes Here?

- Feature ideas
- Improvement suggestions
- Technical debt items
- Research spikes
- Anything worth exploring later

## What Happens Next?

The **Project Manager (Role 12)** reviews backlog items regularly and either:

- Refines them into features with unique IDs in `docs/work/features/todo/`
- Archives them if no longer relevant
- Keeps them here for future consideration

## Tips

- Don't overthink it - rough is fine
- Add context if you can (why it matters, who asked for it, etc.)
- Link to related issues, conversations, or documents
- If urgent, discuss with Project Manager directly
